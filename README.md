# Automated Account (Bot) Detection 

## Team Introduction

This project would not exist if not for the tireless work of the following team members:
**Judith Cuellar**
**Juliet Messier**
**Micheal McCloskey**
**Seren Frazin**
**Stacie Sauer-Rackham**

## Project Overview 
We have developed a machine learning model that predicts the frequency of **Automated Account (Bot)** creation on Twitter. 

Bots undermine the authenticity of interactions on social media platforms. Bots can disseminate misinformation, manipulate trends, and push malicious links&ndash; all of which is harmful to public discourse. 

With the aid of our model, we can battle back the threat of bots on Twitter.
