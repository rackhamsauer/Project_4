# Automated Account (Bot) Prediction

## Team Introduction

This project would not exist if not for the tireless work of the following team members:

**Judith Cuellar**

**Juliet Messier**

**Micheal McCloskey**

**Seren Frazin**

**Stacie Sauer-Rackham**

## Project Overview 
We have developed a machine learning model that predicts the frequency of **Automated Account (Bot)** creation on Twitter. 

Bots undermine the authenticity of interactions on social media platforms. Bots can disseminate misinformation, manipulate trends, and push malicious links&mdash; all of which is harmful to public discourse. 

With the aid of our model, we can battle back the threat of bots on Twitter. 

For more information about Bots, please refer to the following sources:

### Project Question
Can we predict the rates at which new Bot accounts are created on Twitter by using a machine learning model?

### Project Outline

~~We will add a visualized outline later~~

## Data Sources
The following sources will be merged in python to create a robust dataset for analysis:

+ [Twitter Human Bots Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/davidmartngutirrez/bots-accounts-eda/data?select=twitter_human_bots_dataset.csv)&mdash; 37438 rows of data collected from the Twitter API.

+ [Cresci-2017 Dataset](https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/bot-repository/datasets.html)&mdash; an annotated dataset of real and Bot accounts from the Bot Repository. 

### Data Exploration
Our team cleaned these datasets by dropping irrelevant columns, clarifying column names, dropping null values, and converting values to numeric booleans. Once done, we exported the data into a [downloadable csv file](Data/clean_data.csv). 

## Tools
We used the following tools throughout our project:

**Data Transformation**

+ Python&mdash; Pandas, Jupyter Notebook 

**Database**

+ SQL

+ Microsoft Excel

**Machine Learning Model**

+ Python&mdash; Pandas, PySpark, Jupyter Notebook, Pathlib, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Google Colab

**Dashboard**

+ Tableau
